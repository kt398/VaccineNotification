# VaccineNotification
We saw many people struggling to get vaccine appointments, and even struggled with it ourselves. So we decided to make something to assist those in need of vaccines. We made a website where you can subscribe to receive text notifications when a vaccine appointment is available in one of your selected cities.  

Currently, website is not supported on mobile devices and only vaccines through CVS website are accounted for.
